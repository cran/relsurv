\title{Excess hazard function smoothing}
\description{
An Epanechnikov kernel function based smoother for smoothing the baseline excess hazard calculated by the \code{rsadd} function with the \code{EM} method.
}
\usage{
epa(fit,bwin,times,n.bwin=16,left=FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{
Fit from the additive relative survival model using the \code{EM} method.}
\item{bwin}{
The relative width of the smoothing window (default is 1).
}
\item{times}{
The times at which the smoother is to be evaluated. If missing, it is evaluated at all event times.
}
\item{n.bwin}{
Number of times that the window width may change.
}
\item{left}{If \code{FALSE} (default) smoothing is performed symmetrically, if \code{TRUE} only leftside neighbours are considered. }

}

\details{
The function performs Epanechnikov kernel smoothing. The follow up time is divided (according to percentiles of event times) into several intervals (number of intervals defined by \code{n.bwin}) in which the width is calculated as a factor of the maximum span between event times. 
Boundary effects are also taken into account on both sides.
}

\value{
A list with two components:
\item{lambda}{the smoothed excess baseline hazard function}
\item{times}{the times at which the smoothed excess baseline hazard is evaluated.}
}

	   sex=sex,year=year), ratetable=slopop,data=rdata,int=5,method="EM")
sm <- epa(fit)
