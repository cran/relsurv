\details{ 
This function works with tables organised in the format provided by the Human Mortality 
Database. The period lifetables, organized by date of death, must be downloaded separately for men and
women for each country and the top line deleted. The function only works for tables that have yearly
cutpoints for age as well as calendar year (1x1). The only two columns needed are calendar year (Year) 
and probability of death (qx). Death probabilities must be calculated up to age 110 (in yearly intervals).
