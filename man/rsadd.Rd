\title{Fit an Additive model for Relative Survival}
\description{
The function fits an additive model to the data. The methods implemented are the maximum likelihood method, the semiparametric
method, a glm model with a \code{binomial} error and a glm model with a \code{poisson} error. 
}
\usage{
rsadd(formula, data=parent.frame(), ratetable = relsurv::slopop,
      int, na.action, method, init,bwin,centered,cause,control,...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
a formula object, with the response on the left of a \code{~} operator, and
the terms on the right. The terms consist of predictor variables separated by
the \code{+} operator, along with a \code{ratetable} term. The \code{ratetable} term
matches each subject to his/her expected cohort. If the variables are organized and named
in the same way as in the population tables, the \code{ratetable} term can be omitted.
The response must be a survival object as returned by the \code{Surv} function.

NOTE: The time must be in days, and the same
is required for the ratetable variables (the variables used in the population tables), for example age and year (year must be 
given in the \code{date} format, i.e. in number of days since 01.01.1960). 
}
\item{data}{
a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in
the \code{formula}.
}
\item{ratetable}{
a table of event rates, organized as a \code{ratetable} object, such as \code{slopop}. 
}
\item{int}{
either a single value denoting the number of follow-up years or a vector
specifying the intervals (in years) in which the hazard is constant (the times that are
bigger than \code{max(int)} are censored. If missing, only one interval (from time 0 to maximum observation time) is assumed.
 The EM method does not need the intervals,
only the maximum time can be specified (all times are censored after this time point).
}
\item{na.action}{a missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame,
          after any subset argument has been used.  Default is
          \code{options()$na.action}. }
\item{method}{\code{glm.bin} or \code{glm.poi} for a glm model, \code{EM} for the EM algorithm and \code{max.lik} for the maximum likelihood model (default). }
\item{init}{vector of initial values of the iteration.  Default initial
          value is zero for all variables. }
\item{bwin}{controls the bandwidth used for smoothing in the EM algorithm. The follow-up time is divided into quartiles and
 \code{bwin} specifies a factor by which the maximum between events time length on each interval is multiplied. The default
 \code{bwin=-1} lets the function find an appropriate value. If \code{bwin=0}, no smoothing is applied.
}
\item{centered}{if \code{TRUE}, all the variables are centered before fitting and the baseline excess hazard
	is calculated accordingly. Default is \code{FALSE}. }
\item{cause}{A vector of the same length as the number of cases. \code{0} for population deaths, \code{1} for disease specific
deaths, \code{2} (default) for unknown. Can only be used with the \code{EM} method. }
\item{control}{a list of parameters for controlling the fitting process. 
          See the documentation for \code{glm.control} for details.
}
\item{...}{other arguments will be passed to \code{glm.control}.}
}

\details{
NOTE: All times used in the formula argument must be specified in days. This is true for the follow-up time as well as for
any variables needed \code{ratetable} object, like \code{age} and \code{year}. On the contrary, the \code{int} argument requires
interval specification in years.

The maximum likelihood method and both glm methods assume a fully parametric model with a piecewise constant baseline
excess hazard function. The intervals on which the baseline is assumed constant should be passed via argument \code{int}. The
EM method is semiparametric, i.e. no assumptions are made for the baseline hazard and therefore no intervals need to be specified.

The methods using glm are methods for grouped data. The groups are formed according to the covariate values.
This should be taken into account when fitting a model. The  glm method returns life tables for groups specified by the covariates in \code{groups}.

The EM method output includes the smoothed baseline excess hazard \code{lambda0}, the cumulative baseline excess hazard 
\code{Lambda0} and  \code{times} at which they are estimated. The individual probabilites of dying due to the excess risk
are returned as \code{Nie}. 
The EM method fitting procedure requires some local smoothing of the baseline excess hazard. The default \code{bwin=-1}
 value lets the function find an appropriate value for the 
smoothing band width. While this ensures an unbiased estimate, the procedure time is much longer. As the value found by 
the function is independent of the covariates in the model, the value can be read from the output (\code{bwinfac}) and 
used for refitting different models to the same data to save time.

\value{
An object of class \code{rsadd}. In the case of \code{method="glm.bin"} and \code{method="glm.poi"} the class also
inherits from \code{glm} which  inherits from the class \code{lm}.
Objects of this class have methods for the functions \code{print} and \code{summary}.
An object of class \code{rsadd} is a list containing at least the following components:
\item{data}{the data as used in the model, along with the variables defined in the rate table}
\item{ratetable}{the ratetable used.}
\item{int}{the maximum time (in years) used. All the events at and after this value are censored.}
\item{method}{the fitting method that was used.}
\item{linear.predictors}{the vector of linear predictors, one per subject.}
}
