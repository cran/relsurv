\title{Compute crude probability of death}

\description{
     Estimates the crude probability of death due to disease and due to population reasons
}
\usage{
     cmp.rel(formula, data, ratetable = relsurv::slopop, na.action,tau,
	     conf.int=0.95,precision=1,add.times,rmap) 
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
a formula object, with the response as a \code{Surv} object on the
          left of a \code{~} operator, and, if desired, terms separated  by
          the \code{+} operator on the right. If no strata are used, \code{~1} should be specified.

 NOTE: The follow-up time must be in days.
}
\item{data}{
a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the
          \code{formula}. 

}
\item{ratetable}{
a table of event rates, organized as a \code{ratetable} object,
          such as \code{slopop}.  
}
\item{na.action}{a missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame,
          after any subset argument has been used.  Default is
          \code{options()$na.action}.} 


\item{tau}{the maximum follow-up time of interest, all times larger than \code{tau} shall be censored. Equals maximum observed time by default 
}
\item{conf.int}{the level for a two-sided confidence interval on the survival curve(s). Default is 0.95.}
\item{precision}{the level of precision used in the numerical integration of variance. Default is 1, which means that daily intervals are taken, the value may be decreased to get a higher precision or increased to achieve a faster calculation. The calculation intervals always include at least all times of event and censoring as border points.}
\item{add.times}{specific times at which the value of estimator and its variance should be evaluated. Default is all the event and censoring times.}
\item{rmap}{an optional list to be used if the variables are not
          organized and named in the same way as in the \code{ratetable} object. See details below.}
}

\details{
NOTE: The follow-up time must be specified in days. The \code{ratetable} being used may have different variable names and formats than the user's data set, this is dealt with by the \code{rmap} argument. For example, if age is in years in the data set but in days in the \code{ratetable} object, age=age*365.241 should be used. The calendar year can be in any date format (date, Date and POSIXt are allowed), the date formats in the \code{ratetable} and in the data may differ. 

Note that numerical integration is required to calculate the variance estimator. The integration precision is set with argument \code{precision}, which defaults to daily intervals, a default that should give enough precision for any practical purpose.

The area under the curve is calculated on the interval [0,\code{tau}]. 

Function \code{summary} may be used to get the output at specific points in time.

}

\value{
An object of class \code{cmp.rel}.
Objects of this class have methods for the functions \code{print} and \code{plot}. The \code{summary} function can be used for printing output at required time points.
An object of class \code{cmp.rel} is composed of several lists, each pertaining the cumulative hazard function for one risk and one strata. Each of the lists contains the following objects:
\item{time}{the time-points at which the curves are estimated}
\item{est}{the estimate}
\item{var}{the variance of the estimate}
\item{lower}{the lower limit of the confidence interval}
\item{upper}{the upper limit of the confidence interval}
\item{area}{the area under the curve calculated on the interval [0,\code{tau}]}
\item{index}{indicator of event and censoring times among all the times in the output. The times added via paramater \code{add.times} are also included}
\item{add.times}{the times added via parameter \code{add.times}}
