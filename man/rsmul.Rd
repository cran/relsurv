\title{Fit Andersen et al Multiplicative Regression Model for Relative Survival}
\description{
  Fits the Andersen et al multiplicative regression model in relative survival. An extension of the 
coxph function using relative survival.
}
\usage{
rsmul(formula, data, ratetable = survexp.us, int,na.action,init,
      method,control,...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{
a formula object, with the response on the left of a \code{~} operator, and
the terms on the right. The terms consist of predictor variables separated by
the \code{+} operator, along with a \code{ratetable} term. The \code{ratetable} term
matches each subject to his/her expected cohort. If the variables are organized and named
in the same way as in the population tables, the \code{ratetable} term can be omitted.
 The response must be a survival object as
returned by the \code{Surv} function.

 NOTE: The time must be in days, and the same
is required for the ratetable variables (the variables used in the population tables), for example age and year (year must be 
given in the \code{date} format, i.e. in number of days since 01.01.1960). 
}
\item{data}{
a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in
the \code{formula}.
}
\item{ratetable}{
a table of event rates, such as \code{survexp.us}. 
}
\item{int}{
the number of follow-up years used for calculating survival(the data are censored after this time-point). If missing, it is set the 
the maximum observed follow-up time.
}
\item{na.action}{a missing-data filter function, applied to the model.frame,
          after any subset argument has been used.  Default is
          \code{options()$na.action}. }
\item{init}{vector of initial values of the iteration.  Default initial
          value is zero for all variables. }
\item{method}{the default method \code{mul} assumes hazard to be constant on yearly intervals. Method \code{mul1} uses the ratetable
to determine the time points when hazard changes. The \code{mul1} method is therefore more accurate, but at the same time can
be more computationally intensive.}
\item{control}{a list of parameters for controlling the fitting process. 
          See the documentation for \code{coxph.control} for details.
}
\item{...}{Other arguments will be passed to \code{coxph.control}.}
}



\value{
an object of class \code{coxph}.
}

\details{
NOTE: All times used in the formula argument must be specified in days. This is true for the follow-up time as well as for
any variables needed \code{ratetable} object, like \code{age} and \code{year}. On the contrary, the \code{int} argument requires
interval specification in years.
